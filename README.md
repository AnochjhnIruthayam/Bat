Bat Species Event Extraction by Neural Network Classifier
===
This project is made as a part of our Master Thesis

**Required dependencies or programs:**
- SoX
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyBrain
- h5py
- pyqt4

On Windows, Path enviroment must be set for Python and SoX

**General:**

Can be split into three stages: 
- Creating Spectrogram
- Extracting events from spectrogram and labelling them
- Classify events through Neural Network
